# General Practical Refactoring Learning Hour

Template for teaching specific refactorings in practice

## Learning Objectives

- Being able to apply a specific refactoring

## Session Outline

- 5 min connect: 3 Refactorings you already know
- 10 min concept: Demo the Refactoring
- 40 min concrete practice: Practice the same Refactoring
- 5 min conclusion: Do you remember a code where that Refactoring would apply?

### Connect - 3 Refactorings you already know
Form groups where people discuss 3 refactorings they already know

### Concept - Demo your Refactoring (e.g. Split Loop)
Explain your thoughts.
Show it very slowly.
Run the Tests.

### Concrete Practice - Practice the same Refactoring
Form pairs or small groups where the participants perform the same exercise themselves.
A nice to have is when the used Kata provides a chance to do the same refactoring, but on another occasion.

### Conclusion
Ask the participants whether they know a code where that refactoring would apply.
